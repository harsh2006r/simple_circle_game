# simple_circle_game
This is a small interactive game created using Python + Pygame.  A ball is displayed in the center of the screen.  When the user clicks on the ball, it increases in size.  The ball keeps growing based on user interactions.  This project is great for beginners learning Pygame, event handling, mouse click detection, and basic game loops.
